In the cavern of the red cave of Yamalung, a place of accomplishment for the supreme Lotus Born
siddha and his spiritual heirs, a place where the nectar of immortality streams down and
which has always been the palace of the self-arisen deities of long life, following the
request of the lord of the earth and the sky, the regent and throne holder of the government
Nomihan Rinpoche, I, Yönten Gyatso Lodrö Thaye, wrote this in a break while ten of us,
master and students, were practising the approach and accomplishment phases for seven days,
before beginning the general sādhana of the five families of the Illusory Net of Amitāyus
according to the New Treasures of Chokgyur Dechen Lingpa. May virtue and goodness abound!
