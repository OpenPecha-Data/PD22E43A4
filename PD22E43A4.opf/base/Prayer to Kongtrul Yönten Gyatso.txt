Prayer to Kongtrul Yönten Gyatso
by Jamyang Loter Wangpo

kater lung zin bai rö nampar trul
Emanation of Vairotsana, prophesied in kama and terma,
dzö chen nam ngé shingté lam sol jé
Setting forth the way of the five great treasuries,
rimé tendzin yönten gyatsö ter
Holder of the Rimé teachings and treasury of qualities as vast as the ocean,
lodrö tayé shyab la solwa deb
Lodrö Tayé, at your feet I pray!

gön khyö zukku chö kyi ying su dü
Protector, your form-kāya has dissolved into absolute space,
jikten sum gyi dren jé dü chik tor
And all at once, the triple world’s guide has gone.
dak sok gönmé chok kyang lé gyur na
So, out of compassion for those like me who are bereft,
tukjé trulpé dzum shyal ten du sol
I pray that you show us your smiling face once more!

könchok tsa sum denpé jinlab kyi
Through the blessings and truth of the three jewels and three roots,
trulmé trulpé da nang nyur char té
May your unmistaken, moon-like manifestation swiftly appear,
khé tsul sum gyi sil zer bum salwé
Bright with myriad cooling rays of learning’s triple ways,1
dro kün gelek nangwé khyabpar sol
And bathing all beings in the light of virtue and excellence!

To the single-stanza prayer composed by the master himself, Loter Wangpo, who was sustained
by the master’s nectar-like speech, added a prayer for swift rebirth as soon as the master
settled into the peaceful expanse.
