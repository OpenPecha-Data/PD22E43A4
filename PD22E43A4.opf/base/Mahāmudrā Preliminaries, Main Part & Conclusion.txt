Mahāmudrā—Preliminaries, Main Part & Conclusion

by Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Thaye

Namo guru!

Although plenty of Dharma preliminaries are taught,They are all summed up in revulsion and renunciation.Devotion
to the guru too is particularly importantFor traversing the paths and
stages in months or years.Much is said about what's key to the main practice,But there's
no teaching more profoundThan emptiness with compassion at its very core.In your own mind—empty,
clear, unceasing—The three kāyas are, by nature, complete.Recognise them, and then
be watchfully aware.There's no need to look for śūnyatā elsewhere!Cultivate compassion for
all your old mothers,Who, not realising the natural state, are now deluded.A great deal could
be said about concluding practices,But confess any misdeeds right away,And dedicate whatever
virtues you have performedTowards the enlightenment of all sentient beings.And be
sure to recite Mahāyāna prayers of aspiration.

In response to a request from Rinang Khandro,I, Lodrö Thayé, wrote down whatever came to mind.May
it be of benefit to others!

Maṅgalam.
