Advice Given To Lhawang Tashi

by Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Thaye

I take refuge in Padmasambhava.O Kagyü gurus, please grant your blessings!Please turn the minds
of faithful ones towards the dharma;May we embrace the path of liberation beyond return!


Atisha, the protector of the snowland, said:“Among many, examine your speech;When you stay alone,
examine your mind.”Briefly he taught these two points.

The mind is the root of faultsAnd the mouth is the gateway for these faults to emerge.Thus,
always watch over both.

All of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are your own mind;They don’t arise from anything else in the slightest.Everything,
such as joy and suffering, good and bad,High and low, are the conceptual
constructs of mind.

If your mind is pure, you are buddha:Wherever you reside is a pure realm;Whatever you do is
from the state of the dharmatā;Whatever appears is the jewel display of wisdom.

If your mind is of an impure nature,You’ll see faults even in the buddhas,You’ll get angry even
at your parents,Most things will appear as if they were your enemies.

Expectation, fear, attachment, and anger will continue unabated.Such useless things will waste
your life away.Whomever you associate with, there will be discordAnd wherever you stay
it will be uncomfortable.

However much you own, you won’t be content.For everything you accumulate, you’ll need that much
more.

Being distracted again and again by the appearances of this life,Even if you think about practicing
dharmaYou’ll waste your life caught up in present activities.

At first, when you feel a sense of renunciationYou’ll feel like you could be rid of each and
everything you own;Once you become intractable you’ll cling even to needles.

At first, when you feel a sense of devotionYou won’t think of anyone except your guru.After
a while, you’ll have wrong views.

At first, when you feel a sense of faithYour spiritual practice will pile up one on top of the
other;As you get older, all of this fades away.

Whenever you find a new friendYou value their life more than your own.Once your enthusiasm fades
away,You’ll be upset with them as if they were your enemy.

The root of all of these
Is not taking your own mind to be paramount.

If you are able to make use of your mindThen you don’t need to search for some other place of
retreat;When concepts are absent, that is your retreat.

You don’t need to search outside for the guru;The nature of mind is the enlightened guru.

You don’t need to worry about other spiritual practices to be done,Being without distraction
is the heart of spiritual practice.You don’t need to deliberately abandon distractions,If
your mindfulness is firm, things are spontaneously liberated.

You don’t need to fear that afflictions will occur,If you recognize their nature it is primordial
wisdom.

Except for this momentary mind of yours,Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are not established as anything
else.Please always watch over the mind!

Unless mind is tamed within,Outer enemies will be inexhaustible.If you tame the anger within,All
enemies on earth will be pacified.

If contentment does not arise within your mindEven if you have everything you could ever want,
you’ll be like a beggar.Those who are content and rid of clingingAre always rich even without
possessions.

When you accomplish wholesome worldly activitiesAs well as dharma and virtues,Habitual tendencies
arouse mental joy;This causes you to take birth in the higher realms.

That is also impermanent, it is saṃsāra.When looking at the essence of joyful feelings,You see
they are emptyAnd this is a cause for the path of liberation.

Suffering arises from unwholesome
Spiritual and worldly activities.

If you follow after thoughts and afflictionsSuch as hatred, anger, and desire,It will cause
you to take birth in the three lower realms.To be born in any of them brings about unimaginable
torment.

Whatever afflictions or sufferings occur,By looking at their essence they vanish into emptiness.There
is no way for wisdom to revert from that state.

To not separate your mind from thisAnd always guard your mind is critical.The entirety of the
dharma is encapsulated in guarding your mind.The bodhisattva Shantideva spoke of how to
guard the mind:

“For those who wish to guard their minds,This is brought about by mindfulness and introspection.As
is said, 'All should diligently guard their minds!'I fold my hands in reverence to
such persons.”

To practice in accordance with what is said here is critical.That being so, the six collections
of consciousness and all appearing objects,Are simply the magical display of mind’s nature.Thus,
it is a mistake to think there is some agent who practices adoption and rejection.


Even though taking things onto the pathAs an equal taste is supreme,For the beginner, let your
view be highAnd your practice precise.

As it is said, “The human form with its freedoms and advantages is hard to find.”Thinking over
and over about death and impermanence,Give rise to certainty about the infallibility of
karma and its effects.

When you see or hear of another’s deathKnow it to be a warning for you.When you notice the changes
from summer to winterRecall that everything is impermanent

When you catch sight of bees with their honeyKnow that possessions are unnecessary.When you
see a house or town that is emptyConsider it as your own home or dwelling.

When you see others have parted ways with their friendsRecall your own close relations.When
things suddenly happen to others against their willRemember that such things could happen
to you as well.

Self and other—everything—is as a dream;There isn’t even the slightest thing which is truly
established.

When you maintain the natural state as it isWithout spoiling or fabricating your mind,The emptiness
of all inner and outer phenomenaIs realized to be the sky-like union of clarity and
emptiness.

That is ultimate bodhicitta.Migrating beings who do not realize thisWander in saṃsāra under
the influence of dualistic apprehension.

Limitless and unfabricated compassionNaturally arises for those who undergo such torment.This
is relative bodhicitta.

Without grasping at compassion, realize its emptiness.Compassion, the spontaneous energy of
emptiness, will emerge.Union is the essence of the teachings of sūtra and mantra.You should
engage in this profound practice.

The method for having such things arise in your mindstreamIs to accumulate a wealth of merit,
take all of it into your own hands.Pray to the Three Jewels.Take devotion to the guru as
the vital point.

Encourage yourself and others to avoid wrongdoingAnd, however you can, engage in virtue.Do not
separate yourself from the bodhicitta of the Great VehicleNor from pure dedication of your
merit.

The spiritual practitioner known as Lodrö Thayé,An old yogin who does nothing but eat, sleep,
and defecate,Composed this to clear up some things for Devendra,A virtuous-minded person
whose magnificent qualities are like the waxing moon.

May you have long life and master dharma practiceAnd may the two-fold benefit be spontaneously
accomplished!

Sarva siddhirastu maṅgalam!
