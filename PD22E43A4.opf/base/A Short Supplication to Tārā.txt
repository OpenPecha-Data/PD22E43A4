A Short Supplication to Tārā
by Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Thaye

dü sum gyalwa sé ché kyepé yum
With single-pointedness of body, speech and mind,
chomden jetsün pakma drolma dang
I respectfully supplicate the Mother of the Buddhas of the three times and their offspring,
yermé lama sangye kündü la
The victorious one, foremost and exalted Tārā,
go sum tsechik güpé solwa deb
Indivisible from my guru, embodiment of all the Buddhas—
chimé dorjé dewé yeshe kyi
With your deathless and blissful vajra wisdom
min ching drol né dön nyi nyur drub shok
Ripen and liberate me such that twofold benefit is swiftly won!

At the request of Jampel Tendar and many other faithful ones, this was composed by Lodrö Thaye.
May virtue and auspiciousness abound!
