The Kusāli's Instruction on the Nature of Mind

by Jamgön Kongtrul

Namo guru!

Although there are many ways of explaining view and meditation,They all come down to sustaining
the essence of one's own mind.What we call 'mind' is not something that exists elsewhere—It
is the very thought that you are experiencing right now!So without being swept away
and following wherever it leads,Look directly into its face, its very own essence,At that
time, there's no duality of 'looker' and 'looked at'.As it is empty, there's no real substance.As
it is clear, it is aware of itself.These qualities are not separate—they are a unity.Out
of nothing at all, anything at all can arise.You need only sustain this with the mindfulness
of never forgettingThis bare and simple recognition of the nature itself—There's
no need to search for some other object of meditation!Untainted by fabricated hopes and anxieties—
'Is it?' or 'Is it not?'—Allow the mind to settle, directly, just as it is.This
unfabricated and 'ordinary' knowingIs the ultimate clear light of dharmakāya.Although many
special terms exist in Mahāmudrā and Dzogchen,The real root of the practice boils down to
simply this.Not content with this, seeking 'Buddhahood' as some other excellenceIs merely
to be bound up in hope and fear – something to avoid!As a means of bringing about realisation
in this way,Devotion and the accumulations are of the utmost importance,So always emphasise
devotion for the guru and Lord of Orgyen,And strive to practise virtue with your body,
speech and mind.

In response to the request of my own student, Pema Chöpel,A holder of awareness mantras from
Gatö Trindu,I, the kusāli Lodrö Thayé, wrote this from Dechen Ösal Ling.

May virtue and positivity abound!
