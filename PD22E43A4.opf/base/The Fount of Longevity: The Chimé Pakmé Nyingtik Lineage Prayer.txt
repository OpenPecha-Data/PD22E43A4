↑ ‘Wish-fulfilling Wheel’ is an epithet of White Tārā, indicating that she accomplishes continuously
whatever we wish.↑ ‘Power over life’ is one of the ten powers of buddhas and bodhisattvas.
To have such mastery over your lifespan means you can choose to abandon your life
or remain to the end of an incalculable aeon of time, depending on your wishes.  It is said
to result mainly from generosity.↑ This line is a play on one of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo’s
names, Ösel Trulpé Dorje, which was given to him by Vimalamitra.↑ Jamgön Kongtrul Lödro
