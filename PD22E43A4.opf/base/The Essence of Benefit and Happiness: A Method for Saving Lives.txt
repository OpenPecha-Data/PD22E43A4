The Essence of Benefit and Happiness
A Method for Saving Lives
arranged by Jamgön Kongtrul Rinpoche

Homage to the guru, yidam, and dākiṇī!
Among the many types of conditioned roots of virtue, that of ransoming and protecting the lives
of beings has exceedingly great benefits. In particular, to save the lives of farm animals,
livestock and the like not only frees these beings immediately from the fear of imminent
death, it also frees them ultimately from rebirth in the three lower realms, as a result
of being offered to the Three Jewels and receiving blessings upon hearing the buddhas’
names and the dhāranī mantras. Through the power of such virtuous actions, when the karmic
result ripens in accord with the cause, the agent of virtue will undoubtedly experience
great benefits, such as an increased lifespan. Furthermore, to save lives in conjunction with
a ritual practice will greatly enhance its impact. It is for this reason that this text
has been arranged according to the liturgies for the dharmakāya guru of the Guru's Heart
Practice, Dispeller of All Obstacles.

I. Preliminaries
Adorn the ears and so on of the animals to be released with pieces of silk and cloth. Then recite:
1. Refuge and Bodhicitta
sangye chö dang tsok kyi chok nam la
In the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Supreme Assembly,
changchub bardu dak ni kyab su chi
I take refuge until awakening.
dak gi jin sok gyipé sönam kyi
Through the merit of practicing generosity and so forth,
dro la pen chir sangye drubpar shok
May I attain buddhahood for the benefit of beings.
Thus, preceded by refuge and bodhicitta, sprinkle some clean water on the animals.

II. The Main Part
1. The Visualization
Then cleanse them with:
om benza amrita kuntali hana hana hum pé
oṃ vajrāmṛtakuṇḍalī hana hana hūṃ phaṭ
And purify them with:
om sobhava shuddha sarva dharma sobhava shuddhoh hang

4. The Mantra Recitation and Visualization
Then recite the following mantra for the five family forms of Amitāyus:
om buddha ayugyana tsé bhrum, om benza ayugyana tsé bhrum, om retna ayugyana tsé bhrum, om pema
ayugyana tsé bhrum, om karma ayugyana tsé bhrum
oṃ buddha āyujñāna tshe bhrūṃ | oṃ vajra āyujñāna tshe bhrūṃ | oṃ ratna āyujñāna tshe bhrūṃ
| oṃ padma āyujñāna tshe bhrūṃ | oṃ karma āyujñāna tshe bhrūṃ |
Also recite this long-life mantra:
om namo bhagavaté, aparimita ayugyana subini tsita tedza radzaya, tathagataya, arhaté samyaksambuddhaya,
teyata, om punyé punyé, maha punyé, aparimita punyé, aparimita punyé gyana sambharopa
tsité, om sarva samskara pari shudhé dharmaté gagana samungaté sobhava bishuddhé

mahānaya-parivāre svāhā
dak gi tuk né ö tröpé
From my heart center, light rays stream out,
dünkyé gyü kul özer gyi
Invoking the wisdom hearts of the deities in front, so that they project light rays too.
sishyi kham kyi tsechü dang
These in turn gather back the life-essence of existence and peace,
khyepar jung ngé dangchü kün
And in particular the essence of the five elements.
dü té dak dang drubjar tim
These essences dissolve into me and the practice focus.
kham nga nyampa sorchü né
Our depleted five elements are thereby revitalized
rik ngé tsewang tobpar gyur
And we attain the long-life empowerment of the five families.
Imagine that.
5. Offerings and Praise
Then make offerings with:
om benza argham padyam pushpé dhupé aloké ghendhé naividya shapta om ah hum
oṃ vajra arghaṃ pādyaṃ puṣpe dhūpe aloke gandhe naivedye śabda oṃ āḥ hūṃ
For the praises, recite:
yeshe nga yi ngowo nyi
You are the essence of the five wisdoms—
chomden rik nga tsepakmé
You, Amitāyus of the five buddha families
kham nga namdak yum dang jor
United with your consorts, the five elements utterly pure.
tsedak rik ngé tsok la tö
Five family long-life lords, I praise you!

chomden tsé yi lhatsok kyi
Assembly of blessed long-life deities, I beseech you!
dak dang tayé semchen nam
Revitalize the depleted life force and merit
tsesö nyampa sorchü né
Of myself and all infinite beings,
rik ngé tsewang ngödrub tsol
And grant us the long-life empowerments and siddhis of the five families!
Thus praise and supplicate. Then recite:
dün gyi namkhar shyukpé chimé tsé yi kyilkhor ten dang tenpar chepa dewa chenpö ngowor ö du
shyu dak dang drubja la timpé kham nga nyampa sorchü rik ngé tsé dang yeshe kyi ngödrub malüpa
tobpar gyur
The entire maṇḍala of immortality in the sky before me, the support and supported, melts into
light as the essence of great bliss, and dissolves into me and the practice focus. Our depleted
five elements are thereby revitalized and we attain every one of the longevity and
wisdom siddhis of the five families.

III. Conclusion
Generate a sense of certainty while reciting these words. This method for instantaneously restoring
one’s life force when any of the five elements have been depleted is most extraordinary.
Furthermore, in order to avert untimely death and enhance the longevity ritual, diligently
perform the above-outlined practice and offering for animals that are about to be
slaughtered or have been selected for slaughtering, repeating the practice a number of times—corresponding
to the age of animals in years, or three times that amount, for instance.
With butter, draw a sun and moon on the foreheads of the animals. At the end, multiply the
virtue with dedications and aspirations, and toss handfuls of flowers.

An Additional Offering to the Household or Drala Deities
If you wish to combine the life release with a mountain offering to the household or drala deities,
cleanse and purify the prepared decorations, and then recite:
tong pé ngang lé ti yik lé jungwé sok chak kyé ché zuk jé dzé shing yi du ong la nyam top dang
den pa kha lang dang pu lé dö yön na tsok kyi trin trowa chik lé gya tong du ma pelwé kün
tu khyap pa lha sung nam kyi wang po druk gi chö yül du gyé gü long chö kyi nyé par jé
par gyur
Out of emptiness appears the syllable ti, from which emerge the animals to be released, beautiful
in appearance and pleasant to the senses, their figures healthy and strong. Clouds of
sensual delights issue from their breath, their fur and their feathers. Each cloud multiplies
thousands of times, pervading the whole of space with these sensory delights. The deities
and guardians are delighted by this delectable feast, replete with the pleasures of
the six senses.
nama sarva tathagaté bayo bisho mukhebé sarva takham utgaté saparana imam gagana kham soha
namaḥ sarva tathāgatebhayo viśva mukhebhyaḥ sarvathākhaṃ udgate spharaṇa imaṃ gagana khaṃ svāhā
Thus perform the sky-treasury mantra and mudrā. Then bless the offerings with:
om benza saparana kham
oṃ vajra-spharaṇa khaṃ
kyé, mi yi nor chok kang zhi pa
Kyé! So that these animals, the supreme wealth of humans,
trel dang yün gyi dé top chir
May attain both temporary and lasting happiness,
kön chok sum la kyap tsel lo
We entrust them to you, the Three Jewels.
chok sum tuk jé kyop par dzö
O Three Jewels, please care for them with compassion!
tsawa sum la gü chö bül
These offerings we make in devotion to the Three Roots.
tsa sum jin gyi lap tu söl
O Three Roots, please grant your blessings!
chö kyong nor lhé ten du dzuk
May they become supports for the Dharma protectors and wealth deities.
sung ma nor lhé gyé par zhé
May the guardians and wealth deities delight in them.

sok la chak pé lü chen kün
May all embodied beings, those endowed with life,
né kap chi dak jik lé dröl
Be freed from the fear of the Lord of Death,
tar tuk tsé dang yé shé ö
And ultimately attain the glory
pak tu mé pé pel top shok
Of Infinite Light of Life and Wisdom3

Thus conclude with prayers of dedication, aspiration and auspiciousness, while tossing flowers.
In general, all those beings whose lives have been freed should be shown the chakras that
liberate upon sight; they should smell the incense that liberates upon smell; and they
should be anointed with the powder that liberates upon touch. Place these sacred objects
and a liberation-upon-wearing amulet on their heads. Give them cleansing water mixed with
samaya substances to drink as the liberation-upon-taste. Finally, it is very important to
recite within hearing distance dhāraṇīs and mantras of the Nyingma or Sarma schools—such as
those found in Liberation Upon Hearing from the Peaceful and Wrathful Deity cycles4, the
Essential Liberation Upon Wearing5, the Hundred-Syllable mantra, the Śodani, Kaṃkani, or
Lotus-Uṣṇīṣa mantras, and the names of the buddhas, such as Vajrasattva, Amitābha, Akṣobhya,
and Ratnaśikhin—as well as aspiration prayers. Afterwards, release the beings in a suitable
place and ensure that they are protected from being slaughtered in the future.

This later ritual was extracted from The Innermost Secret, Unsurpassed Longevity practice of
Longsal Nyingpo. I have merely added some supplementary prayers to the ritual, assuming that
this could benefit some practitioners. Thus, I, Padma Garwang Lodrö Thayé, compiled this
ritual in Dzongshö Derdü Phodrang. May virtue abound! Sarvadā maṅgalaṃ!
